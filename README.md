VideoGenHub is a one-stop library to standardize the inference and evaluation of all the conditional video generation models.

* We define 2 prominent generation tasks (Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video).
* We built a unified inference pipeline to ensure fair comparison. We currently support around 10 models.

## 📰 News
* 2024 Jun 10: [GenAI-Arena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04485v1) Paper is out. It is featured on [Huggingface Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers?date=2024-06-10).

## 🛠️ Installation [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
To install from pypi:
```commandline
pip install videogen-hub
```

To install from github:
```python
git clone https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/VideoGenHub.git
cd VideoGenHub
cd env_cfg
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
pip install -e .

### Benchmarking
To reproduce our experiment using benchmark.

For text-to-video generation: 
```commandline
./t2v_inference.sh --<model_name> --<device>
```

### Infering one model
```python
import videogen_hub

model = videogen_hub.load('VideoCrafter2')
video = model.infer_one_video(prompt="A child excitedly swings on a rusty swing set, laughter filling the air.")

# Here video is a torch tensor of shape torch.Size([16, 3, 320, 512])
```

## 🧠 Philosophy [🔝](#-philosophy-)
By streamlining research and collaboration, VideoGenHub plays a pivotal role in propelling the field of Video Generation.

* Purity of Evaluation: We ensure a fair and consistent evaluation for all models, eliminating biases.
* Research Roadmap: By defining tasks and curating datasets, we provide clear direction for researchers. 
* Open Collaboration: Our platform fosters the exchange and cooperation of related technologies, bringing together minds and innovations.

### Implemented Models
We included more than 10 Models in video generation.
